# Description
This project organizes a database of information for an e-commerce site. Using sequelize to interact with MySQL, relationships are created between each model in the database. The API Routes perform restful crud operations to get, update, create, and delete items in the database for the e-commerce site.  

## Usage 
Linked below is the video walkthrough of the command line running the SQL database, and seeding the database, and testing each CRUD route using Insomnia.
